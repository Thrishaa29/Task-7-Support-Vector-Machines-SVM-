# Task-7-Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
# Breast Cancer Detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project demonstrates a binary classification pipeline using Support Vector Machines (SVM) on a breast cancer dataset. The key focus is to train models with different SVM kernels, visualize decision boundaries, and evaluate performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is assumed to be a CSV file (e.g., `breast-cancer.csv`) containing features extracted from digitized images of breast mass samples. It includes a `diagnosis` column with values `'M'` (Malignant) and `'B'` (Benign).

---

## ‚úÖ Steps Performed

### 1. **Load and Prepare the Dataset**
- Loaded the CSV file using `pandas`.
- Converted categorical labels (`M`/`B`) to binary (1/0).
- Selected only two numerical features (e.g., `radius_mean` and `texture_mean`) for simplicity and 2D visualization.
- Standardized the features using `StandardScaler`.

### 2. **Train SVM Models**
- Trained two SVM models:
  - One with a **Linear Kernel**.
  - One with an **RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel**.
- Used `scikit-learn`'s `SVC` class for model training.

### 3. **Visualize Decision Boundaries**
- Plotted decision boundaries using `matplotlib`.
- The background shows the classification region, and the data points are overlaid for interpretation.

### 4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Used `GridSearchCV` to tune:
  - `C` (regularization strength).
  - `gamma` (for the RBF kernel).
- Performed a grid search over multiple values using 5-fold cross-validation.

### 5. **Cross-Validation Evaluation**
- Evaluated the best model using `cross_val_score` with 5-fold CV.
- Reported individual fold accuracies and the overall mean accuracy.
